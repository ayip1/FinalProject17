# FinalProject17
My game is based on an old game I have played for years:Oldschool Runescape. The game is heavily based on a story used from the game
and manipulated slightly. The game prints a lot of the story and there is interaction in the game. As the player, you are an adventurer
in the kingdom of Kandarin. Thoros is in trouble and you have to help him. Although there is the option to say no, the game
is sort of handicapped and loops back so that you have to press yes. When you reach the cave and fight the spider, I used randint for an
rng based part of the game which is probably the only fun part unless you enjoy the lore. I did not use any outside resources. If I had an error
I tried solving the problem myself and if I really couldn't solve it, I asked a friend to help.
